# Icelandic Gambit

![Icelandic Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/icelandic-gambit.jpg)


The Icelandic Gambit is an aggressive alternative to the Scandinavian Defense.  Instead of taking the pawn on d5, black looks to give up the material in exchange for developmental lead and a semi-open file for his queen.
1. e4 d5
2. exd5 Nf6
3. c4 e6
White has to be very careful as the Icelandic Gambit has many different traps that one can fall into.  Black has all of his pieces positioned nicely while white has none of his pieces developed and a pawn structure that lacks substance going into an end game.
If you find yourself playing against e4 and want to try a new approach, then the Icelandic Gambit is a great alternative to the Scandinavian Defense.  Enjoy!
