        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4"> The English opening is the 4th most common opening for white. Although the English has its own style, the opening is very flexible and many times transposes into other opening lines. The objective of the opening is to apply pressure on the center d5 square without committing the queen pawn or the king pawn. Since the move is a flank move many players like the English because of its hypermodern style of play (using pieces from the sides along with minor pieces to apply pressure and control the center).</p>
