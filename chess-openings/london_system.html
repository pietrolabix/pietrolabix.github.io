<p>The London System is a great chess opening for beginning chess players. It quickly develops the dark square bishop which is a very underutilized minor piece for white.</p>
<p>The opening doesn’t start out aggressive, and many times ends in a closed game, but it gives white lots of options and is very useful is stopping black from any counterattack.</p>
<p>The London System is extremely good against the King’s Indian Defense systems as black becomes cramped and is left with little room to do anything.</p>
<p>Even if you are a skilled player this opening still has much to offer and you can rest assured that you won’t falter with the opening lines because they are pretty straight forward.</p>
