<p></p>
<p>The Colorado Gambit is an aggressive line in the Nimzowitsch Defence. Black looks to weaken his king side pawn structure in exchange for some deadly attacks against white. This is a solid opening for black but usually works best as a surprise opening against a player that hasn’t studied all of the lines.</p>
<p>1. e4 Nc6
2. Nf3 f5</p>
<p>White must play carefully as there are many traps and dangerous lines that black can play. Unlike other gambits, black would prefer that white not take the pawn on f5. Instead, black would like to control the center of the board with the f5 pawn and quickly development the rest of his pieces.</p>
<p>Many of the variations in this opening have safe lines and aggressive lines. If you choose to play the Colorado Gambit I recommend you go with the more aggressive lines. Because e4 is so common, you’ll have many opportunities to try out this opening.</p>
