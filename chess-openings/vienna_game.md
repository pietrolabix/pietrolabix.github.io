The Vienna Game is one of the most fundamentally sound openings in chess. It follows all of the basic opening principles and allows for creativity for both aggressive and non-aggressive players.
1. e4 e5
2. Nc3
Black has three main options to respond to the Vienna Game. They are 2….Nf6, 2….Bc5, 2…..Nc6. Each response from black opens up the door for white to choose how the game will proceed.
White can play a quiet game, simply developing minor pieces towards the middle of the board and try to stay ahead in time and space, or white can play a gambit with f4, transposing into various King’s Gambit lines.
For those players that enjoy playing the King’s Gambit, Halloween Gambit, Three Knights Game, or just simply want something different than the Ruy Lopez, I recommend this opening. It is easy to learn and gives you lots of options that your opponent might not be ready for.
