<p></p>
<p>The Queen’s Indian Defense is an extremely solid hypermodern defense against the d4 opening from white. It usually arises if white chooses to avoid the Nimzo-Indian defense by bringing his knight to c3 and instead opts to first bring his knight to f3.</p>
<p>1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e6
3. Nf3 b6</p>
<p>Black prepares to fiachetto his light square bishop and try to take control over both the center light squares as well as the long diagonal.</p>
<p>White has a few options but usually will opt for g3, challenging the long diagonal by fianchettoing his own bishop to g2.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other Indian defenses, black has many opportunities to play aggressive which makes it very popular at top level play.</p>
