<p>The Muzio Gambit is one of the most aggressive lines in the already aggressive King’s Gambit.</p>
<p>1. e4 e5
2. f4 exf4
3. Nf3 g5
4. Bc4 g4
5. 0-0</p>
<p>Instead of counter attacking with the knight on f3, white gives that knight up in exchange for a massive attack with his bishop, queen and castled king. Black is up in material but has a weakened king side and no developed pieces.</p>
<p>There are numerous traps that black can fall into and it is extremely difficult to avoid all of them</p>
<p>If you are an aggressive player and like sacrificing material in exchange for a huge assault on your opponent, I recommend trying out the Muzio Gambit.</p>
