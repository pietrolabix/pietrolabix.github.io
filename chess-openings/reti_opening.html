        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4"> The Reti Opening has at times been referred to as the Opening of the Future. It is called this because of how easy it is to transpose into a variety of different opening lines. Many players have a very defined defense as black but against the Reti, black is forced to almost wait and see which opening line white will take. Some of the main opening lines that the Reti will transpose into are the Queen’s Gambit, the English, the Ruy Lopez, or the King’s Indian Attack. As you can tell, white has many different options to choose from, even after he has already moved.</p>
