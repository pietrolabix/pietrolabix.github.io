# Scotch Gambit

There are a few ways to offer a gambit as white in the Scotch Game.  The most common, and one that we will focus on this page, is white playing Bc4 instead of taking with his knight on d4.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4 exd4
4. Bc4
This does many different things but it delays the middle control of the board with the knight and pawn in exchange for a very powerful bishop that eyes down on the f7 pawn from black.
While the Scotch Game can be one of the slower games and can lead to very unexciting matches, the Scotch Gambit takes it to the other extreme as both sides have the opportunity to give up material early on in exchange for a non-material, yes crucial, advantage.
If you play this opening it’s always important to know how to respond to your opponents moves because one misstep and you will find yourself very behind.
