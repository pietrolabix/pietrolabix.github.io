<p></p>
<p>The Locock Gambit is a very aggressive line in the Philidor Defense and starts with the moves:</p>
<p>1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 d6
3.d4 Nf6
4.Ng5 h6
5.Nxf7</p>
<p>The Philidor Defense is generally pretty passive. When you start out with e5 and d6 you are playing for a very long game by building up a strong pawn structure. This can be very frustrating for many players starting out with e4 because they are looking for an aggressive start.</p>
<p>With the Locock Gambit, white is able to regain the initiative and play a very aggressive line. The knight is sacrificed and in exchange, white is able to launch a strong attack against black</p>
